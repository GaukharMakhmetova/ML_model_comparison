# ML_model_comparison
Conducted ML algorithms efficiency comparison analysis based on learning curves, easiness to tune parameters and running times using Python
Fllowing models were examined by time of running and accuracy of the model. 
- Logistic regression
- Decision tree
- Decision tree (max_depth = 5)
- KNN (k = 2)
- Random forest
- Extra trees
- Gradient Boosting
- Naive Bayes - Gaussian
